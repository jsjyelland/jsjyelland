 ### <samp>**👋 Hey, I'm James Yelland.**</samp>

🎓 I'm a sixth-year mechatronics engineering student at the University of Queensland.

🤖 I love to work on robotics & AI projects. I used to compete at the RoboCup Junior competition in the soccer division, and have since worked on a few robotics projects with uni.

I currently work as an undergraduate engineer doing discrete-event simulation at Hatch.
I also develop web & mobile software for a music education company, Accent Publishing.

Things I'm interested in:
